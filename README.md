My first attempt with Robot Framework.   

Library used: Selenium2Library 
IDE: Eclipse with RED plugin Scripting Language: Python  

The project contains the following robot test suites:  
1. MyFirstTest - Very basic web navigation 
2. SearchFlightRobot - Referenced from Internet 
3. Amazon_Simple - Just with Test cases and Settings (very basic for beginners to understand) 
4. Amazon_Advanced - Progressed a bit from the Simple Test Suite 
5. Guru99 - Automating the guru99's sample web banking   

PS: I'm a beginner in Robot Framework. I will keep adding different test suites as i progress
